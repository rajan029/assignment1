Q1. Create one variable containing a string, list, float, and tuple:

You can bundle different types of data into a single variable using a tuple. Here's an example:


mixed_data = ("Hello", [1, 2, 3], 3.14, (4, 5))


In this example, `mixed_data` contains a string ("Hello"), a list ([1, 2, 3]), a float (3.14), and a tuple ((4, 5)).

Q2. Data types of given variables:

1. `var1 = ' '` : This is a string.
2. `var2 = '[ DS , ML , Python]'` : This is also a string, despite looking like a list.
3. `var3 = ['DS', 'ML', 'Python']` : This one is a list.
4. `var4 = 1.0` : This is a float.

 Q3. Explanation of some operators with examples:

(i) `/` (Division Operator)
This operator divides one number by another and gives the result as a float. For example:


result = 10 / 3
print(result)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335


(ii) `%` (Modulus Operator)
This gives you the remainder after dividing one number by another. For instance:

python
remainder = 10 % 3
print(remainder)  # Output: 1


(iii) `//` (Floor Division Operator)
This divides one number by another, but instead of giving a float, it rounds down to the nearest whole number. For example:

python
floor_result = 10 // 3
print(floor_result)  # Output: 3


(iv)(Exponentiation Operator)
This operator raises a number to the power of another. For instance:


power = 2 ** 3
print(power)  # Output: 8


Q4. List of mixed data types and their types:

Let's create a list with different types of data and then print each item with its type:


my_list = [42, 'Python', 3.14, True, None, [1, 2, 3], (4, 5), {'key': 'value'}, {9, 8, 7}, b'bytes']

for element in my_list:
    print(f'Element: {element}, Data type: {type(element)}')


Q5. Check if a number is divisible by another using a while loop:

Here's how you can check if one number (A) is purely divisible by another (B) and count how many times it divides:


A = 100
B = 5
count = 0

while A % B == 0:
    A = A // B
    count += 1

if count > 0:
    print(f'A is divisible by B {count} times.')
else:
    print('A is not divisible by B.')


Q6. Check if elements in a list are divisible by 3:

Create a list of 25 integers and use a loop to check if each one is divisible by 3:


int_list = list(range(1, 26))

for number in int_list:
    if number % 3 == 0:
        print(f'{number} is divisible by 3')
    else:
        print(f'{number} is not divisible by 3')


 Q7. Mutable vs Immutable Data Types:

Mutable Data Types:These can be changed after they're created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Example of mutable data type:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 4  # Changing the first element
print(my_list)  # Output: [4, 2, 3]
```

Immutable Data Types:These cannot be changed once they're created. Examples include strings, tuples, and numbers.

Example of immutable data type:
`
my_string = "Hello"
try:
    my_string[0] = 'h'  # Trying to change the first character
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: 'str' object does not support item assignment

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
try:
    my_tuple[0] = 4  # Trying to change the first element
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
